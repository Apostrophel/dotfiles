# My personal dotfiles
These are my personal cofiguration files and install scripts for backing up and easy reinstallation. 

## Install 
Clone the repository and run the script `./install_dotfiles.sh`.

## Updating the configs
The symlink set up should automatically take care of updates, just make sure to update the shell files in this repository, not the `.bashrc` in the home directory.
